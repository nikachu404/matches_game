 <h2 align="center">📋About📋</h2>

This is a simple matchsticks game implemented using React. The objective of the game is to take turns removing matchsticks from the board. The player and the AI take turns, and the player who has an even number of matches left at the end of the game wins

The game board displays the current number of matchsticks and allows the player to select the number of matchsticks to take in each turn using a slider. The AI player makes decisions based on certain rules to maximize its chances of winning.

The game page is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. The game settings and state are saved in the browser's localStorage, allowing players to resume their game settings later.

Enjoy playing the Matches Game!
